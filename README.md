# SPAM_Classifier
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as "ham" or "spam." "Ham" messages are regular texts from friends, while "spam" messages are unsolicited advertisements. The model will be trained on a labeled dataset to learn patterns and features, enabling effective filtering of unwanted messages.
